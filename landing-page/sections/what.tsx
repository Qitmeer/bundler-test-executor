      <p className="leading-loose text-base mb-12">
        Account abstraction moves crypto from the current approach of a simple EOA account, where one can lose
        everything with a small mistake, to a future where an account can be tailored to their needs using smart
        contracts.
        <br />
        <br /> The shift from EOAs to smart contract wallets with arbitrary verification logic paves the way for a
        series of improvements to wallet designs, as well as reducing complexity for end users.
